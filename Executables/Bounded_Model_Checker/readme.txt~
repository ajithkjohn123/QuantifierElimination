All the experiments reported in the paper on the 
VHDL designs in ../../VHDL_Designs/ are done using the 
executable Bounded_Model_Checker. 

Dependencies : 
--------------

1) For SMT solver calls during Quantifier Elimination,  
the solver simplifyingSTP is needed.  
Hence please include stp in the PATH before executing 
Bounded_Model_Checker.  The version of stp used is included 
in the folder ../Quantifier_Eliminator/Dependencies/simplifyingSTP/

2) For translating the property in bounded PSL to SMTLIB 
format, we use a property translator named propTrans. 
Please include propTrans in the PATH before executing 
Bounded_Model_Checker. The version of propTrans used is included 
in the folder Dependencies/Property_Translator/


Steps in reproducing the experiments
------------------------------------

Let design.vhd be the name of vhdl file.

To run without abstraction, 

1) First generate the verification condition, i.e., 
unrolled transition relation with negation of property 
conjoined. To do this, execute,


time Bounded_Model_Checker -abstraction-off -unrollings=500 -exit-after-vcgeneration property_bpsl.txt design.vhd


This gives verification condition in verification_condition.smt
(The time for generating the verification condition and details 
of transition relation are outputted on the screen)

2) Check satisfiability of verification_condition.smt. 
 To do this, execute, 


time stp -g 1800 verification_condition.smt (with word-level simplifications on) and 
time stp -g 1800 -w verification_condition.smt (with word-level simplifications off) 
(In some cases, we have seen that stp with simplifications on takes more time. Hence, 
minimum of solving time with and without the word-level simplifications is taken) 



To run with abstraction by QE_LMDD, 

1) First generate the abstract verification condition, i.e., the 
unrolled abstract transition relation with negation of property 
conjoined. To do this, execute,


time Bounded_Model_Checker -abstraction-on -unrollings=500 -exit-after-vcgeneration -quantifier-eliminator=qelmdd  property_bpsl.txt design.vhd


This gives abstract verification condition in verification_condition.smt
(The time for generating the abstract verification condition, details 
of transition relation, time needed by QE_LMDD are outputted on the screen)

2) Check satisfiability of verification_condition.smt, by executing, 


time stp -g 1800 verification_condition.smt (with word-level simplifications on) and 
time stp -g 1800 -w verification_condition.smt (with word-level simplifications off). 
Take the minimum among the times.
